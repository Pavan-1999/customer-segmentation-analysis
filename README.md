Customer Segmentation & Analysis - Data Analytics Project 🚀
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using data analytics and machine learning to help businesses understand their customers better. We performed data preprocessing, clustering using K-Means, and visualized insights using Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard for decision-making.
🎯 Objective
•	Segment customers based on Annual Income & Spending Score
•	Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing
•	Visualize key insights using Power BI
•	Apply Python, SQL, and Machine Learning to real-world business problems

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used
✅ Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Data Cleaning & Clustering)
✅ SQL - Data Querying & Preprocessing
✅ Power BI - Dashboard & Visualization
✅ K-Means Clustering - Machine Learning Algorithm for Segmentation

📊 Dataset Details
•	Source: Mall Customer Segmentation Data
•	Columns: 
o	CustomerID - Unique identifier for customers
o	Gender - Male/Female
o	Age - Age of the customer
o	Annual_Income - Income in $1000s
o	Spending_Score - Customer's spending behavior (1-100)

📌 Steps in the Project
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python & SQL)
✔ Checked for missing values & duplicates
✔ Standardized numerical fields for analysis
✔ Renamed columns for clarity
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Visualized Age, Income, and Spending Score distributions
✔ Identified trends in customer spending
3️⃣ Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)
✔ Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
✔ Segmented customers into 4 groups:
•	VIP Customers: High Income, High Spending
•	Impulsive Shoppers: Low Income, High Spending
•	Cautious Spenders: High Income, Low Spending
•	Budget Customers: Low Income, Low Spending
4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development
✔ Built an interactive dashboard with:
•	Scatter Plot - Customer Segmentation
•	Cluster Distribution Chart
•	Spending Behavior by Gender
•	Age Group Distribution ✔ Added Slicers for dynamic filtering

🔹 Key Insights from the Analysis
📌 High spenders tend to have a stable income – Targeted promotions can be used for retention.
📌 Impulsive spenders with lower income – Businesses can offer loyalty programs to maintain engagement.
📌 Older customers tend to be more financially cautious, whereas younger customers spend more frequently.
📌 Male and female customers show different spending behaviors, influencing marketing strategies.
